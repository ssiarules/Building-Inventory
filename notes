User 

Building 

Products 

Floors 


rails g resource Building name floor_num:integer
rails g resource Floor name floor_num:integer building:belongs_to
rails g resource Product name cateogory floor_num:integer in_stock:integer description:text date_added:datetime user:belongs_to floor:belongs_to
rails g resource User username email building:belongs_to


ADD A REFERENCE COLUMN TO AN EXISTING TABLE 
1. rails g migration AddBuildingIdToProducts building:references

REMOVE A COLUMN FROM A TABLE 
1. rails generate migration remove_COLUMNNAME_from_TABLENAME COLUMNNAME:DATATYPE 
rails generate migration remove_date_from_buildings date:date
- 
ADD A NEW COLUMN TO AN EXISTING TABLE
add new column to an existing table 
1. generate a new migration - rails g migration add_building_id_to_products building_id:integer
2. manual add the change column inside the product table migration.

Concerns:
    1. Ever users should be able to see building inventory of any building they selected to view inputs that was added from other users. They should also be able to makes edits. 
        Try. in my User create action add a redirect to the building/show new user selected. 

    2. would I need to add validates to my product model for no double cateogories? 

clear and rests table 
rake db:schema:dump
and then:

rake db:schema:load
